# Publication Artifact Provenance

This document maps the main paper-facing results to their generating scripts and source artifacts. Use it when checking manuscript claims, presentation figures, or final publication tables.

## Canonical Environment

For publication regeneration, use:

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv-publication
source .venv-publication/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements-verified.txt
PYTHONPATH=src MPLBACKEND=Agg python scripts/generate_all_results.py
```

The exact verified package set is recorded in `requirements-verified.txt`.

## Interpretation Rules

- Treat `results/`, `figures/`, and `reports/` as generated evidence, not as independent claims.
- Every manuscript metric should trace to one source artifact in this file.
- The descriptor-graph prototype should be labeled exploratory because the primary QSAR dataset does not contain molecular graphs, SMILES, or BigSMILES.
- The BigSMILES/Tg benchmark supports polymer representation discussion, but it does not provide biodegradation labels and should not be presented as validating biodegradation prediction.
- Before submission, verify dataset licenses and citations for every dataset used or redistributed.
